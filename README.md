# BEC_ML_thesis

In these folders you can find the codes developed for the Bachelor thesis at University of Trento.

In src there is the code to compute the ground state energy of a BEC with ML. To run it you need to compile all the files in src.

In data_analysis there are two python codes used to compute the uncertanties and to compare the data (obtained with the code in src) with an interpolation of results found in literature.
