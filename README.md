# BEC_ML_thesis

In these folders you can find the codes developed during my Bachelor thesis at the University of Trento (Italy) and at the University of Oslo (Norway).

In src there is the code to compute the ground state energy of a BEC with ML. To run it you need to compile all the files in src.

In data_analysis there are two Python codes used to compute the uncertanties and to compare the data (obtained with the code in src) with an interpolation of  the results found in the literature.
